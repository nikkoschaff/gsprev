/*

$$$1: TODO reflect changes: 
	A: Teacher.h to match DD
	B: only answers, no questions for now (reflect in DD)
	C: reflect changes in DD (q/a now in vector, not map)
	D: reflect changes in DD (no private EvalHelper in class)
$$$3: Set standards

I: TODO
	A: Viewer
***		1: TODO show exam image when doing refreshInfo
			-> Yeah....get around to that
$$$		4: Create a warning if no key selected


	B: GUI - other issues
$$$		1: Image bitmaps aren't loaded correctly upon startup


II: Database concerns
	1: What happens if searching out of index or availability? (or at a table that doesn't exist)
		-> BREAKS if asking for something that doesn't exist
	2: It's easy to have linked duplicates.  Would that also unnecessarily duplicate searches?
	

III: Image Evaluator -> modify to work with new image, and apply needed changes
		(more to be added as needed)
